# Description
This is a minimalistic and color-blind-firendly Stata graph scheme.

# Main features
* All graph elements apart from those depicting the data are de-emphasised to the necessary minimum, allowing thus the data content to dominate.
* The colour scheme is friendly to colour-blind people.

# Installation
To install the graph scheme, open Stata and issue the command:

``net install minimal_colorblind, replace from(https://raw.githubusercontent.com/irubil/minimal_colorblind/main)``

# Acknowledgement
The color scheme is borrowed from Asjad Naqvi's white_tableau scheme, availabla as part of [schemepack](https://github.com/asjadnaqvi/stata-schemepack/blob/main/README.md).
