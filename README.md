# minimal_colorblind
A minimalistic and color-blind-firendly Stata graph scheme.

This is a minimalistic scheme where:
(i) all graph elements apart from those depicting the data are de-emphasised to the necessary minimum, allowing thus the data content to dominate; 
(ii) the colour scheme is friendly to colour-blind people (borrowed from Asjad Naqvi's WHITE_TABLEAU scheme).

To install it, open Stata and issue the command:   
'''net install kaksongen, replace from(https://raw.githubusercontent.com/irubil/minimal_colorblind/main)
