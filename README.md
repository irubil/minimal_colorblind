# minimal_colorblind
This is a minimalistic and color-blind-firendly Stata graph scheme.

## Main features
* All graph elements apart from those depicting the data are de-emphasised to the necessary minimum, allowing thus the data content to dominate.
* The colour scheme is friendly to colour-blind people.
* It is meant mainly for the most frequently used graph types, such as twoway, bar, and dot graphs, while it may not be optimal for other graph types.

## Installation
To install the scheme from within Stata, issue the command:

``net install minimal_colorblind, replace from(https://raw.githubusercontent.com/irubil/minimal_colorblind/main)``

## Acknowledgement
The color scheme is borrowed from Asjad Naqvi's white_tableau scheme, available within [schemepack](https://github.com/asjadnaqvi/stata-schemepack/blob/main/README.md).
