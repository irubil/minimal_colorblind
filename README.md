# minimal_colorblind
This is a minimalistic and color-blind-firendly Stata graph scheme.

The distinctive features of the scheme, relative to the default Stata scheme s2color, are:

[SCHEMEPACK](https://github.com/asjadnaqvi/stata-schemepack/blob/main/README.md)

This is a minimalistic scheme where:
(i) all graph elements apart from those depicting the data are de-emphasised to the necessary minimum, allowing thus the data content to dominate; 
(ii) the colour scheme is friendly to colour-blind people (borrowed from Asjad Naqvi's WHITE_TABLEAU scheme).

To install it, open Stata and issue the command:

``net install kaksongen, replace from(https://raw.githubusercontent.com/irubil/minimal_colorblind/main)``
