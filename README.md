# minimal_colorblind
This is a minimalistic and color-blind-firendly Stata graph scheme.
Its main features are:
* all graph elements apart from those depicting the data are de-emphasised to the necessary minimum, allowing thus the data content to dominate;
* the colour scheme is friendly to colour-blind people.

The color scheme is borrowed from Asjad Naqvi's white_tableau scheme (see [schemepack](https://github.com/asjadnaqvi/stata-schemepack/blob/main/README.md)).

To install the graph scheme, open Stata and issue the command:

``net install minimal_colorblind, replace from(https://raw.githubusercontent.com/irubil/minimal_colorblind/main)``
